            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I designed a 16 page booklet as a project for the company Etsy to target both sellers and buyers in how Etsy provides an excellent sustainable ecological culture at their company. As part of the assignment, we were given placeholder text and challenged to create unique visuals, design decisions, creative header titles in order to create a consistent tone that still maintained formality and information.</p>
            <br>
                
    My goal was to create a comprehensive system that spanned different mediums: digital, print, and shirt. One of my main challenges was to iterate and expand on a previous design, so that Alpha Kappa Psi on campus could start to build a recognizable brand from semester to semester. Within these creative restrictions, I created a fresh look while still maintaining the professional image that Alpha Kappa Psi portrayed on campus.

            <h3>Design Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a design that functions as a system (grid, typography, layout)</li>
                <li>Address the needs of multiple stakeholders (editorial tone, image selection, color palette)</li>
                <li>Communicate clearly (scan-ability, progressive disclosure)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
