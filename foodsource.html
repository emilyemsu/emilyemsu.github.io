              <p><strong>Role:</strong> UX Researcher</p>
              <p><strong>Research Tools:</strong> User Testing, Mechanical Turk, Survey Writing, Rapid Prototyping</p>
              <p><strong>Team:</strong> Annette Chen, Helen Kim</p>
              <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Apr 2016 - May 2016 (2 weeks)</p>

            <div class="two-column">
                <p>While the class Crowd Programming's final project was to create a working prototype using crowd workers, focusing on implementing Mechanical Turk with a web interface, I wanted to hone my research skills in validating an idea through rapid prototyping, survey writing, and remote user testing.</p>

                <h2>Initial Research</h2>
                <p>I posted an initial survey to Mechanical Turk and various social media platforms to gather some data about habits and preferences that people had around cooking to see if our app would be useful. We were able to survey a diverse group of 79 people, across different ages and ethnicities. Along with this demographic diversity, we also found great variety in cooking patterns. People cook at different frequencies and have different priorities while cooking, but there were overall positive responses for a platform that would help users find recipes given ingredients and an occasion.</p>

                <h2>Research driven development and rapid prototyping</h2>
                <p>Due to the time constraint, we decided to do research driven development-- building alongside conducting research.We wanted to validate whether or not people would be enthusiastic about a recipe Q&A app, so we could address users while still getting a functioning application prototype so that we could have Mechanical Turk workers test.</p>

                <h2>Test research results</h2>
                <p>In order to test whether our app would be an effective use of the crowd and populate responses, we had three parts in our survey: demographic questions, tasks interacting with the app, and reflection questions.  We posted our web app link on Mechanical Turk and asked users to ask, answer, and vote. We originally had some questions that we populated in the app for workers to base off on. In order to verify that they actually were on our application, we asked what question they asked and answered, and asked them to find a hidden code that we left on each page. Reflection questions involved gathering data on their experience with the app, possibility for continued use, and their workflow as they completed the tasks. We gave out 20 cents a response, and submitted 25 HITs for the workers.</p>

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>The experience we had with this project actually brought many surprises to our team. The team's working hypothesis was that the crowd would end up relying on search engines to provide the relevant recipes and we brainstormed ideas to validate using the crowd above simply using search engines for these queries. However, most of the workers gave recipes mostly based on personal experience and even when they searched for recipes online, they provided personal insight into the response. We were also pleasantly surprised by the amount of interest shown in the application -- working on this project, we recognized the uniqueness of the platform: it allowed a variety of different backgrounds to come together and provide insight into the diverse culture around cooking.</p>

                <p>In the future, I would like to take this initial research into the design process in order to create a working prototype to understand what a complete user experience may look like in this field.</p>
