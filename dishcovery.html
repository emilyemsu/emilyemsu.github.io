            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>At the hackathon, Hack The North, this past October in Waterloo, Canada, my teammates and I tackled the Yelp Adventure Challenge, which was to create a platform that could inspire adventure. From there, we decided to build Dishcovery, as we firmly believed that the best way to get to know the city is through its food. From this starting point, we created a web app that builds your own food adventure with a couple of simple fields, including center of the adventure, what meals you want to include for the day, and level of popularity and well-knownness.
            </p>

            <h3>Design Process </h3>
            <p>I designed the user experience of the project, while learning web development tools. From my first hackathon, I learned how to quickly prototype and iterate, especially under a time constraint. I was realized how adaptive these designs needed to be, especially in getting the technology to work while making the experience as smooth as possible for the user.
