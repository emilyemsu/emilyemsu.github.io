            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The nation-wide famous Burnt Almond Torte is housed in a small, local bakery in our very own Pittsburgh, PA. While its cakes are an essential highlight to the city, I wanted to completely rethink and redesign Prantlsâ€™ website in order to increase its aesthetic appeal, as well as make it simpler for the user to navigate through. I, alongside a team, for our Intro to Web Design class, decided to create a information focused website for Prantls Bakery.  
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
We reconsidered the information architecture of the site, recreated its brand, and developed a modern-vintage feel to the website. In addition, we wanted to highlight the photography on the website to invite the user to its beautiful selection. Furthermore, we simplified the navigation so that it was clearer to find essential features of a bakery: hours and location, history, and menu.
