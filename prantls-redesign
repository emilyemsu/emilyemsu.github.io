            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>At the hackathon Hack The North this past October in Waterloo, Canada, I was part of the process in creating Dishcovery, as the best way to get to know the city is through its food. From this inspiration, and a submission of the Yelp Adventure challenge, we created a web app that builds your own food adventure with a couple of fields, including the center of your food adventure, level of hipsterness, and meals chosen.

            <br>
            <p>I designed the UX/UI of the project, while learning web development tools. What I learned most out of my first hackathon experience is how crucial a functioning application is--while we wanted to make the application as comfortable to the user as possible, we need to get a functioning prototype before stylizing and otherwise.
